# Transport Layer Problems

1. A sender needs to transmit 31 bytes of data using TCP, with a Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of 11 bytes. If the initial sequence number is 1, what will be the sequence number and acknowledgment number of the last segment?

2. TCP is being used between sender and receiver over a full-duplex link. The following is the scenario:
- The sender has 5 segments to transmit each of 2000 bits, and the ACK will be of 10 bits.
- The link data rate is 1 Mbps.
- The one-way propagation delay of the link is 100 ms.
What is the minimum value of the sender's window size in terms of the number of frames needed to achieve a link utilization of 50%?
