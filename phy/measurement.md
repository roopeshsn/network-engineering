# Internet Measurement Definitions

Bit rate: The number of bits that are sent every second.
For example, a 30 Mbps connection from ISP will transfer 30 Megabits per second. 1 million bits is one Megabit.

Bandwidth: Maximum bit rate of a system over a period of time.

Bandwidth-delay product = Bandwidth (in bps) * RTT (in seconds)

Throughput: Measure of actual data flow over a period of time.
Give an example to depict the difference between bandwidth and throughput

```
Throughput = Bits / RTT (in seconds)
```

Latency: The time a packet took to reach from source to destination. Usually it'll be measured as Round Trip Time (RTT). 

RTT: Client to Server and Server to Client
